# Setting up Different VivalArc Versions

In the root directory, there is a file named vivalarc.css, which serves as the default style for VivalArc. However, since users have different preferences, I’ve fine-tuned several variants of VivalArc for everyone to choose from.

## Overview of Different Versions

Currently, there are two variants available: vivalarc-larger-ui and vivalarc-compact-ui. The visual differences between these versions are minimal, but I plan to introduce more adjustments based on user feedback.

## Setup Instructions
In Vivaldi’s settings, when selecting the custom UI Modification, simply choose the vivalarc-larger-ui or vivalarc-compact-ui folder. You can refer to the demonstration video below for a detailed guide on the setup process.
